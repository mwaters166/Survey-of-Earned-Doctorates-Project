# Survey-of-Earned-Doctorates-Project
Goal: Graph Survey of Earned Doctorates Data by Year, Ethnicity/Race, and Field of Degree Awarded

Purpose: Developing strategies to increase diversity in higher education and retain underrepresented minorities (URMs) until graduation is an important task (especially in STEM fields). Therefore, we need to understand current trends in URM graduation numbers in graduate education.

The data table in the repository was adapted from Table 23: "U.S. citizen and permanent resident doctorate recipients, by broad field of study, ethnicity, and race: Selected years, 1997â€“2017" from the NSF website. The code outputs graphs of Percentage of Earned Doctorate Degrees (of total degrees awarded for the year) VS. Year (from 1997-2017), and graphs are broken down by field/educational department.
